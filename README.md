This project represents a comprehensive coffee shop management application that has undergone significant enhancements:

Database Integration:

The program has transitioned from using text files to utilizing a Microsoft Access Database (.accdb) to store and manage menu items, providing a more robust and structured data storage solution.
Menu Display and Management:

A form has been created to display the coffee shop's menu using a DataGridView control, presenting only summary information such as title, category, and retail price. Detailed information, including images, is displayed separately upon selecting a menu item.
A search and display functionality allows users to view all menu items and perform category-based searches. Search results are displayed in a DataGridView, and detailed information can be accessed as needed.
A new menu item form has been modified to store new menu items directly into the database.
Menu Item Deletion and Modification:

A new form enables users to view the menu, select an item, and delete it from the database, utilizing the previously implemented search and display capabilities.
Another form allows users to select a menu item, edit its detailed information, and update the database with changes. This feature provides flexibility in modifying menu items' attributes, such as images, descriptions, and costs.
Order Management:

The order creation form has been updated to store order transactions and associated information, including date and time, customer details, employee records, and total cost, as new records in an orders table within the database.
Order Display:

A form has been added to allow users to view all recorded orders, sorted by price or date. This can be presented using either a ListView or a DataGridView control, listing all relevant order data.
MVC Design Pattern:

The program has been developed following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern, ensuring separation between the core components, such as Menu, MenuBuilder, and MenuDisplay classes, and the user interface.
Proper naming conventions have been adhered to, in line with C# standards.
In summary, this project demonstrates a robust coffee shop management application that leverages a database for data storage, streamlines menu management, offers search and display functionality, facilitates menu item creation, modification, and deletion, and provides comprehensive order management and display features. The implementation adheres to the MVC design pattern and follows naming conventions for clarity and maintainability.
